                in the fewest number of attempts possible.</div>
            <div class="rules-text">In each turn, you have to select a combination of colors, which is presented as a
                row on the board.</div>
            <div class="rules-text">After each attempt, check to see if the combination matches the winning combination
                or not.</div>
            <div class="rules-text">The computer will mark the colors that are in the correct position with purple, and
                the colors that are in the incorrect position with white.</div>
